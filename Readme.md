# Machine Learning

Machine learning Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This repository will focus on machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised) in python. 

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/AmnaLaghari/machine-learning.git
```
Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it.

```bash
pipenv shell
```
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages from requirements.txt

```bash
